Codebase for my MSc Bioinformatics research project titled: Predicting ecosystem gross primary productivity under ongoing climate change using machine learning. 
This codebase primarily contains the data preprosessing workflow utilising with daily FLUXNET data alongside the model weights and cross-validation utilised in the study. 
I am slowing introducing the code utilised for the analysis steps of this project as i clean up and optimise the pipeline.
